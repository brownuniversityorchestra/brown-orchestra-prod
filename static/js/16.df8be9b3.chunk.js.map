At rehearsals, he religiously takes off his shoes before stepping behind the 5-octave Marimba. His hands sprint up and down the bars while his feet bob up and down, trailing the swells of his playing. Watching him play, a natural question arises for the audience: Why does Ryan Sawyer play barefoot? `}</p>\n    <p>{`Ryan is concentrating in Applied Math and Music. He began his time at Brown in the fall of 2019 with the expectation that he might try a variety of fields outside of music, though he found himself repeatedly signing up for classes in the Music Department. Now, with his schedule packed with hours of practicing percussion and plans for a Masters in Music in the future, he is preparing to pursue music professionally. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Growing up in Marietta, Georgia, Ryan started his musical journey with piano. He wasn’t as serious about music then, and he left piano behind as his interests turned to percussion. “I kind of fell into percussion–I knew piano, and that meant I already knew the notes and rhythm to play stuff,” he says, recalling his introduction to percussion in middle school band. He found more opportunities to focus on playing percussion in high school, such as playing in the school band and in the Atlanta Quest Percussion Ensemble for WGI, an organization that facilitates percussion competitions between various youth ensembles. Though the style of playing in these ensembles is different from classical performance, he internalized certain elements—tempo, ensemble playing, and a great joy in playing music—that has become part of his musicianship.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While college offered even more ways for Ryan to explore music, the beginning of the COVID pandemic in the Spring of 2020 disrupted his experience. Despite the challenging situation, Ryan found new ways to deepen his engagement with music, and he began working as an organist at a church in his hometown. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“That’s where I saw what playing music professionally would be like,” Ryan remarks. Week after week, he played various hymns for the church, but he also found himself with a lot of creative freedom for playing postludes. The responsibility of playing to a crowd of people week after week also allowed him to practice how to ease his performance nerves.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The long periods of time during the COVID isolation also provided Ryan with time to pursue his interests in composition as well. One piece that he shared with me is a piece called “Sandflea.” It features two clappers, whose intersecting, shifting, complementing patterns of claps takes the listener through interesting changes of mood. In his music, Ryan points out that he often relies on rhythm and harmonic structure instead of melody. But why? `}</p>\n    <p>{`A few years ago, Ryan discovered that he experiences something called aphantasia. To understand what this is, imagine what you experience if I ask you to think about the beginning of Beethoven’s 5th. You can probably hear the melody in your mind. But Ryan cannot represent a picture or a sound to himself in his imagination. `}</p>\n    <p>{`When I react to this revelation with shock, Ryan shrugs. It doesn’t pose much of a noticeable difference in his daily life, he tells me, and he just assumed that when people said something like ‘Apple,’ their mind was directed towards facts about the word rather than a mental image of it. The one drawback he experiences is that he has trouble writing melodies–perhaps as a result of being unable to play a tune to himself in his mind. But these qualities in turn mean that Ryan directs his focus towards harmonic and rhythmic structure. With a mathematician’s eye, Ryan can hone his rhythms to be as precise as possible, and he can understand the relations between chords like how a logician navigates the steps of a proof. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Following this revelation, I wonder what his way of experiencing music means for his performance of the Creston Marimba Concerto. For one thing, he tells me, what goes through his mind when he plays his music are bodily movements. Each scale, each run, each rhythm corresponds to certain motions of his body–an outbreath, the rising of his chest, or a shift of his body into the ground. These movements in turn give Ryan the feel for how to interpret the music. The flow of his body movements are tied to the flow of the music as he navigates the small changes in dynamic and articulation and phrasing and timing. `}</p>\n    <p>{`For this reason, Ryan Sawyer does not wear shoes when he plays. Like a dancer who wants precise, unmediated contact with the ground in the course of their performance, Ryan wants to feel the ground vibrate when the contact of his mallets with the marimba bars sends a ripple of sound through the marimba’s resonators and into the ground. He compares this experience to a circuit: The feedback from the ground moves through his body, which he then releases back into his playing. And over the course of his performance, the electric current from Ryan’s mallets sweeps through all of the orchestra and the entire hall, until we are all left in stunned wonder.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
