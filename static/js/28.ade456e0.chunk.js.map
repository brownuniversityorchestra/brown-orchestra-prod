In\n1917, the czar of Russia was overthrown. By 1920, the Bolsheviks, a Marxist revolutionary\nparty, had executed the former czar and secured control over Russia and many of its former\nimperial territories, founding the Soviet Union, with their Communist Party in charge.\nIt was in this revolutionary Soviet context where Shostakovich began work as a\ncomposer. The 1920s Soviet Music scene was a pluralistic environment where many styles of\nclassical music, from experimental avant-garde music to more traditional compositions jostled\nfor a place as music fitting of the revolutionary era. Shostakovich’s atonal and dissonant\ncompositions of the 1920s also pushed the boundaries of traditional classical music.\nHowever, beginning in the late 1920s under the Bolsheviks’ new dictator, Joseph Stalin,\nthe atonal style of the early-to-mid 1920s was discouraged. Instead, optimistic and nationalist\n“Socialist Realism” music that would lead the country into the socialist utopia was in favor.\nShostakovich himself came under crossfire after, in 1936, Stalin himself attended a performance\nof Shostakovich’s acclaimed (but provocative and dissonant) opera, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.\nThe dictator did not enjoy the opera, and the next day, the state-run newspaper Pravda published\na scathing review of Shostakovich’s music. Overnight, Shostakovich went from a celebrated\ncomposer to anathema. He began to sleep on the stairwell of his apartment, to spare his family\nfrom violence in case he was arrested in the middle of the night.`}</p>\n    <p>{`At the same time, beginning in 1936 and 1937, Stalin began mass purges of the Soviet\nelite in what would be known as the Terror. Anyone, from loyal Communist Party officials to\nordinary citizens, could be arrested and disappear: executed or sent to labor camps. Mikhail\nTukhachevsky, a Communist Party official and artistic patron of Shostakovich, was arrested and\nshot. In this context of suspicion and fear, Shostakovich premiered his 5th Symphony.\nMost historians interpret Shostakovich’s 5th Symphony as an effort to compose an\noptimistic piece that matched the party line. The 5th Symphony begins with a bold and\nrecognizable sonata in the 1st movement, mixed with slower, somber moments. The 2nd\nmovement is an energetic, lively scherzo. This is followed by the dramatic, percussive, and\nsomber 3rd movement. The symphony ends with an overtly joyful, triumphant 4th movement.\nShostakovich publicly stated that his 5th Symphony was inspired by human optimism, and it was\nindeed a critical (and political) success, rehabilitating him in the Party’s eyes.\nSome historians, conductors, and musicologists theorize that Shostakovich purposefully\nhid an element of subversion within the 5th Symphony’s notes. They might understand the\nsomber tone in the 1st and 3rd movements as a cry for help or expression of fear. Others interpret\nthe triumphal 4th movement’s final march, with its almost agonizingly repeated chords, as a\nstatement of angst, rather than a triumphant finale. Yet others question the idea that Shostakovich\nwould have taken the risk of including hidden notes of subversion within the very symphony\nintended to rehabilitate his image.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The 5th Symphony is a complicated piece, and it is impossible for us to know with\ncertainty what Shostakovich felt and thought of the music. For each of you audience members,\nthe Symphony will likely conjure up unique emotions and thoughts as well. There is no\nobjectively correct take on the 5th Symphony, no correct way to “feel” or interpret it. However, it\nis our hope as the Brown University Orchestra that through this piece, Shostakovich says\nsomething to you tonight. We hope you enjoy our performance!`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`References`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Robinson, Harlow. “Symphony No. 5.” Boston Symphony Orchestra.
