While I sat outside my apartment on the 7th floor, legs dangling from the edge of the fire escape, looking down at the rest of the city, I felt the gradual awakening of each street—the cogs beginning to churn and click: birds chirped delicately, 24-hour diners’ door chimes rang frequently, paperboys lobbed rolled-up morning editions onto doorsteps. And then, everything came to live at once. Apartment windows were cranked open, unleashing the curtains into the misty air. The ladies, in their high heels and floral shirtwaist dresses, click-clacking along the sidewalks. The gentlemen, in their dark suits and half-windsor ties, hollered to the next available taxicabs while scarfing down coffee with one hand and clamping an overflowing briefcase shut with the other. Finally, the sun revealed itself entirely from beneath the clouds of dawn. I knew the rest of the day was going to be great. And just for a moment, nothing in the past meant anything to me: I was off fantasizing about what was to come.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then I blinked again. My trip to the city was over. I was transported back into a music hall, engulfed in shimmering melodies radiating from a solo violinist: Daniel Xu ‘26.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The concertoist will perform Erich Wolfgang Korngold’s Violin Concerto in D Major with the Brown University Orchestra for the season opening concert on Saturday, October 18, 2025.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In his four years at Brown, Daniel has refined his idea of what a musician is. It’s not a virtuoso flashing a grin every other measure while scaling Mount Rushmores of technique to impress the audience. Instead, Daniel emphasizes the need to share with the audience. With friends, family, with anyone who’ll lend an ear. Through this appreciation for community, he finds that his music transcends beyond performances put on for show. Daniel’s musical journey with the violin has guided him to the BUO, chamber music, and ultimately, his late-romantic companion for the Concerto Competition—the Korngold concerto.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A St. Louis native, Daniel began playing the violin at seven years old. In sixth grade, his musical passion surged when he joined a local community orchestra for the first time. Despite having no expectations with a seat in the back of the second violins, Daniel decided it was worth a shot to see what an ensemble was like. It ignited a spark. `}</p>\n    <p>{`\"﻿I remember we played Verdi’s `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvjqrI24SsE\"\n      }}>{`Overture to La forza del destino`}</a>{`, and I remember just thinking, wow, this is so cool,” he shares. “That experience was so cool just to see how when you’re in an orchestra, one plus one is more than two. One plus one plus one is a million because of what you can do with a bunch of other musicians in this amazing setting; it’s just out of this world.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`From then on, classical music became more integrated in Daniel’s life. Lessons became something he looked forward to each week. He felt encouraged to explore different avenues. However, his relationship with music wasn’t always as harmonious as it is today. `}</p>\n    <p>{`For young, aspiring musicians, music conservatories are the gold standard for higher education, but the audition process is just as taxing as writing application essays. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“I was planning on applying to conservatories, but ended up getting slightly burned out during my senior year of high school. I didn’t really want to continue with the instrument anymore,” Daniel recalls. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In retrospect, he notes that there isn’t a thing he would trade for his experiences. He realizes that music doesn’t have to exist solely in prestigious spaces like Juilliard and Curtis. “Brown really just changed things and made me really want to pursue music even more,” he says.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Daniel stirred up the courage to audition for the BUO in his first semester of college. With Gustav Mahler’s fifth symphony in the opening concert program, the violinist quickly reclaimed his passion while surrounded by a welcoming community that motivated him to continue music.`}</p>\n    <p>{`He’s constantly reminded of an adage his sister tells him: happiness shared is happiness doubled. “I think that’s a really salient message because as classical musicians, there is an expectation of perfection and following norms,” Daniel says, rejecting the quixotic standards of the classical world. “Your goal shouldn’t be to satisfy all these strict requirements but to just make other people happy. I’m just playing to have fun. And why would I play music if I’m not having fun or if I’m not making other people have fun?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Alongside chamber music and the Applied Music program, Daniel’s perspective changed while learning an entire violin concerto, something he hadn’t really done in either middle school or high school. `}</p>\n    <p>{` For him, the Korngold started as a fun side project over winter break. In November, 2023, he had attended the Rhode Island Philharmonic’s concert starring violinist `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.riphil.org/blog/meet-the-soloist-randall-goosby\"\n      }}>{`Randall Goosby`}</a>{` who performed none other than Korngold’s violin concerto. Daniel found the Decca Classics artist’s interpretation transcendent.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“`}{`[`}{`Compared to] your Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Sibelius, the Korngold does different things, both in terms of harmonies and structures. The overall meaning just stuck out to me because it didn’t feel like any concerto I had heard before,” he says.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And that was the charm of Korngold. The Late Romantic giants charged through oceanic depths of color and tone to construct monumental works that trample elegance and wring out every drop of emotional intensity from an ensemble with upwards of 100 instruments. It’s fair to say this style of composition found its way into the Hollywood composer’s heart, but he strewed his palate with pigments of rose-tinted nostalgia and zealous whimsy rather than overtly expansive chroma of heart-wrenching lament and fantasized übermensch.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I just think that `}{`[`}{`Korngold’s] trying to send a different message… There’s not a lot of really minor modes or heavy, saddening melancholy. And yet it’s beautiful, and it’s blissful, and it’s very entertaining to listen to,” says Daniel.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Daniel highlights the piece’s effervescent brevity, too: “the mindset of a violin concerto not having to be this grand romantic masterpiece but… a little compelling story that you get to tell—that was really alluring to me. It’s like a little interlude that, for 25 minutes, takes you somewhere else and then returns you all happy and joyous.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`But stories—certainly, Korngold’s—are often told with more than one character. By juggling cinematic themes between the solo violinist and every section of the orchestra, he creates a restless, dynamic dialogue. The frequent interplay of the D Major concerto makes Daniel’s own story all the more satisfying. He reflects on his last opening concert with the BUO as a testament to the power of community and camaraderie in rekindling his love for musicmaking:`}</p>\n    <p>{`“It’s hard to imagine playing this concerto with any orchestra that’s not the BUO.”`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Daniel Xu ‘26 concentrates in Chemistry and Music.
