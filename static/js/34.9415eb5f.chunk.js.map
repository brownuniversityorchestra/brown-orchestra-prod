Gotsch. Gotsch is a senior double concentrating in music and geology-biology, and plans to attend music graduate school in the future. I had the honor of sitting down with Gotsch and hearing about their initial foray into music, memories at Brown, and inspiration for their piece. Here I present: a “Portrait of T. Gotsch.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Introduction to Music`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`With encouragement from an arts-oriented family, Gotsch has been involved with music from a young age, from piano lessons at the tender age of four to school providing instruction in recorder, trumpet, and ukulele. “It’s just been like a constant through my whole life,” they said. But they found one of their first big passions when they began to play double bass in the seventh grade band. “I was playing trumpet at the time,” Gotsch described, “but there was this really, really cool bassist…and I had a big crush on him. And my cousin used to play bass and had gone to law school at that point. `}{`[`}{`He] no longer was playing. The family wanted to get rid of the bass.” That’s when Gotsch inherited the bass and began to play.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But even though an innocent schoolyard crush and happenstance with obtaining a bass led Gotsch to begin playing the instrument, they found themselves genuinely drawn to the world of bass. “In high school, I started playing a bit more intensely,” they said. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world in 2020, Gotsch began to explore and take interest in “many different kinds of music,” and started composing. This continued on into college, where Gotsch has taken a variety of music classes in conducting, composing, and more.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Musical Experiences at Brown`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Academic courses have augmented Gotsch’s ability to become involved with other aspects of the Brown musical community. After taking a conducting class taught by Mark Seto, director of the Brown University Orchestra, Gotsch has been able to apply the skills gained to their conducting experiences in multiple ensembles. In fall 2024, they founded and conducted the Vivo Ensemble for Contemporary Music. They have also conducted `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`The Nutcracker`}</em>{` pit orchestra for two years.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As a performer, Gotsch has played with countless ensembles, including the New England Philharmonic, Providence Medical Orchestra, Brown chamber music, and the BUO itself. Gotsch has also served as BUO’s president, and was instrumental in catalyzing the orchestra’s French Canada Tour, which will take place in March 2026.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In terms of composing, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Portrait of a Cardinal`}</em>{` is not Gotsch’s first piece that the BUO will be playing. Last year, the orchestra played their arrangement of Rachmaninov’s Piano Sonata No. 2, 2nd Mvmt. But Gotsch highlighted how `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Portrait of a Cardinal`}</em>{` is special for them in that they composed it from scratch. “As a composer, I feel like you don’t really have anywhere to hide when your music is played. As an arranger, you take someone else’s music and then you write it for a different ensemble. But it’s a different feeling when you are the one who has written out all of the notes and chosen all of the dynamics and come up with everything that the orchestra is now playing because that is a different level of intimacy….There’s such an immediate connection between the music that you wrote and what the orchestra is playing on. And so it’s really powerful because of that.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Gotsch also emphasized how their performing and conducting experiences have helped inform their composition decisions. “As an orchestral musician, I think it’s helpful for writing an orchestra piece because you can kind of tell what people like to play and what they don’t. So I think that part of it was fun because I got to write parts that I thought would be fun for `}{`[`}{`each instrument]. With conducting specifically, you get a better understanding of how the orchestra responds, issues with balance, `}{`[`}{`and] a better understanding of the orchestra as an organism or…ecosystem. And I think that is very valuable for writing a piece for orchestra.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Connection to the Cardinal`}</strong></p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Portrait of a Cardinal`}</em>{` is a bright and wonderful piece to listen to even if one does not know the context behind it. The first time I heard it, I could pick out the cardinal calls that lay its groundwork. But as I talked with Gotsch, I realized that the piece has a lot more meaning and abstraction than first meets the eye.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Gotsch dedicated `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Portrait`}</em>{` to Jan Tullis, a geologist and professor emerita at Brown who passed away last fall. Tullis served as an important mentor to Gotsch. “She was just this really wonderful, incredibly strong woman….She was the matriarch of the Earth Sciences Department for decades and just loved teaching, being outside, nature, and birds. `}{`[`}{`She] truly cared about how people were growing and really listened.” When Gotsch first came to Brown, Tullis gave them a warm welcome and a tour around the geology department, playing no small part in their decision to ultimately enroll at Brown. “We talked about science, but we also talked about nature and art and the human experience.” Tullis became Gotsch’s first-year exploratory advisor. Then, during their second year, Gotsch became a Meiklejohn peer advisor paired with Tullis to mentor new first-years, as well as a teaching assistant in Tullis’s classes.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Portrait`}</em>{` reflects Tullis and Gotsch’s shared love for birds and the natural environment. “The pieces that I’ve been writing recently have all involved either birds or water….The natural world is a huge source of inspiration, musical and personal, for me,” Gotsch said. Cardinals in particular represent a piece of childhood for Gotsch. “I grew up in Chicago. There’s a lot of cardinals there; it’s the state bird of Illinois. But `}{`[`}{`also in] many different folk traditions, cardinals represent a visit from a loved one who’s passed, kind of like a visit from his spirit on the other side. And so I thought that was kind of a nice way to tie it all together.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Gotsch explained that their piece not only depicts people’s point of view when hearing cardinals, but also the point of view of the cardinal itself. “It’s titled `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Portrait of a Cardinal`}</em>{` because there’s the more realistic portrait of cardinals. At one point, people are just playing with straight transcriptions and it sounds a little bit noisy and chaotic, and it’s fun. But then I think I tried to get a little bit more of an abstract portrait in some parts where it’s like, what would it feel like if you were a cardinal and you were flying? Or how do you capture the feeling of wind moving through trees or the feeling of a chorus of cardinals coming together? How would it feel if you were a cardinal and you started to sing?”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Reflections: Community`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Throughout the interview, Gotsch reiterated that some of their most memorable music experiences had to do with the community and the connections they were able to forge with others by spending meaningful time with friends and advisors. “Watching the bass section grow from four people to nine people over the past two years has definitely been a highlight. I love the bass section so much…just a wonderful group of people and friends that has been really special,” Gotsch said, when asked about one of their fondest musical memories. “Another highlight at Brown is definitely `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`The Nutcracker`}</em>{`, and…all of the smaller performances that happen throughout the year with friends, chamber groups, AMP `}{`[`}{`Applied Music Program] recitals, groups that are just organized by people, just playing music with friends. There’s nothing that really replaces that.”`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Gotsch is deeply grateful for the mentorship and guidance of their primary composition teacher Anthony Cheung, orchestra director Mark Seto, orchestration teacher Wang Lu, bass teacher Nancy Kidd, Jan, and for the support of their family and friends.`}</em></p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
