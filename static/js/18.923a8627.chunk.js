Lili often followed her sister Nadia to her music theory lessons at the Paris Conservatory at a young age, and later on learned the piano, violin, cello, and harp. She had survived pneumonia at the age of two and suffered from its aftereffects, as well as Crohn\u2019s disease, throughout her life, which limited her prospects of marriage.
