In seventh grade, an encounter with Robert deMaine, the principal cellist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, marked the beginning of his lasting relationship with the cello.

Sedong fondly reminisces about those early lessons where deMaine encouraged him to strive for more than just technical proficiency. \u201cEvery lesson stretched my brain,\u201d he reflects, revealing the transformative power of storytelling through music.
