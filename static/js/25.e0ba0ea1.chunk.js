My name is Torben Parker, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of serving\nthe Brown University Orchestra (BUO) as president this year. I wanted to take the time to reflect with you all on the year, and give thanks to the people who have made this year possible. In September, we were eager to perform in the new Lindemann Performing Arts Center. The venue gave us the opportunity to grow as an ensemble. With the acoustical adjustments the Lindemann acousticians coaxed the building into, we have been able to\xa0perform with more harmony (pun not intended) than ever before. Though some may call it a mere \u201cice cube\u201d or a \u201ctakeout box,\u201d the Lindemann has allowed us to share our music with the world more than ever, from playing with the renowned Itzakh Perlman and Randall Goosby on Bruch\u2019s 1st Violin Concerto and with the Brown University Chorus on the Finale of Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony, to Eric Nathan and Sawako Nakayasu\u2019s ",Object(a.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Open Again a Turn of Light"),", and Shostakovich\u2019s 11th Symphony.

The Orchestra Family Feud event was an acute test of this, being an especially tense moment between the families (no blood was shed as far as I know).
