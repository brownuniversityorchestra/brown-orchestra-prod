When I posed this question to Nick Huang, he answered that music allows him to express himself, but also to help others understand his unique way of understanding music. When I heard this, I was, of course, a little confused- I’d been expecting to interview a cellist and pianist, not a philosopher! How could an audience hear a musician’s identity in their music, when all they received is sounds of varying frequencies and wavelengths?\nHowever, Nick explained his thoughts. He sees his approach to music as a twofold approach. Each person experiences a performance a little differently, yet broadly similarly – the highest fortes, the softest pianos. To experience music, as a player or listener, is to connect ourselves to the present, past, and future all at once. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Nick was born in Chicago, IL, into a music-loving family. His mother is a former singer, while his father is a classical music record collector. Naturally, at the age of eight, Nick started the piano, and at age ten, the cello, and quickly found an outlet for his energy in his instruments. Nick didn’t describe his early musical career as irritating or time-consuming; rather, he simply enjoyed it. For him, it was a medium of self-expression and fun, “music for music’s sake.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`He feels his skills started being challenged the most in high school. In 2016, Nick switched to a new piano teacher, Brenda Huang, who pushed Nick to focus on technical mastery and competition. Stepping out of his comfort zone, Nick entered state and national piano competitions and made the Illinois All-State Orchestra on the cello. According to Nick, there was something different about competitions to him than just “playing for fun.” While competing pushes musicians to their technical best, they leave very little room for their own feelings and interpretation. So later on, when Nick started college at Brown, the Brown music department was a breath of fresh air, allowing him to work at his own pace and enjoy playing music with his teachers and his peers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Music also serves as a journey of self-discovery for Nick. According to him, “If we put our hearts and souls into a goal, we’ll eventually get there and learn a lot along the way.” Self-discovery, in his words, was in “the ‘little moments,’ the gratifying feeling we get after pulling off a run in the practice room, or the laughs we share during breaks in rehearsal.” Important for Nick, too, is the ability to bounce back. “We’re all our own worst critics,” Nick told me, admitting with a laugh that he sounded like a broken record in saying that. “Being able to see the good in your own performance, though, is the most valuable thing we can do as musicians.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`His most challenging and rewarding experiences, however, were as a chamber and orchestra musician. As a lifelong cellist, I was surprised at this- how could playing with an orchestra be more difficult than managing two hands at once as a pianist? According to Nick, learning a solo instrument, despite using all ten fingers independently, was easier because he could play at his own pace. Working as a cellist in chamber and orchestral settings, by contrast, pushed him to hone his sense of musical collaboration, a skill he uses in everything from his biology lab work to his club, Healing Through Harmony. “Music teaches you how to listen,” he said. Nick maintained that many of his best friends are musicians, often from orchestra and chamber programs. Music was an experience he used to both connect with and understand others, and refine his own skill.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I was further intrigued, and asked about Nick’s reasons to play George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue as a concerto with Brown University Orchestra. Nick immediately described the Rhapsody as a sociable piece. In his words, the Rhapsody is “the kind of piece that you’d go to the bar and get a couple beers with, and then play darts and pool together.” When I asked him to elaborate, he explained that in his view, Gershwin “pulled the essence of America’s pop culture into music.” As an ex-jazz pianist, Nick’s approach to the Rhapsody was shaped by Gershwin’s considerable jazz influence. “In jazz there are no wrong notes,” he said. “It’s so much more important to embody the spirit of the piece and convey its message rather than avoid the wrong notes.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Essentially, Nick believes that the “performance of your lifetime” isn’t just an act of musical technique. It’s also about making the audience feel the vibe of the music, to “Let the way I feel in the moment dictate the feel of the piece.” Nick quickly added that this off-the-cuff playing style certainly wouldn’t fly for a Rachmaninoff concerto, but fits right in for a piece like the Gershwin, one that “doesn’t take itself too seriously.” In this frame of thinking, the audience isn’t just a passive observer of music, but actively participating in the piece, as the musician creates an experience that everyone can understand, a glimpse into the unique, situational psyche of the musician and the composer. `}</p>\n    <p>{`However, Nick also had his own personal motivations and emotions he wanted to convey in the Rhapsody in Blue. He first learned the piece under his late composition teacher in high school, Dr. Bruce Berr, former faculty at Northwestern University, who passed away from cancer in 2018. According to Nick, “That was another reason why I wanted to bring the Gershwin back- I kinda brought back the feeling of studying under him by playing the piece. The Rhapsody symbolizes another way music is so powerful- so many of our memories are tied to sounds and music and music can help us relive those memories.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`So often, as musicians, I feel we can focus entirely on the technical aspects of a piece, without focusing on what the piece means to us and to others. We neglect to convey aspects of music that can’t be fully expressed by a tempo marking or crescendo. While Nick’s approach certainly deals with the former, he also incorporates the latter, creating an experience that ties the present to the past and future, the musician to their audience, a timeless and euphoric experience.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
