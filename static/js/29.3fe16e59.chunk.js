Most people don\u2019t listen to music they dislike or music that causes them to fall asleep. Instead, we listen to music because it makes us feel something, whether joy, empathy, or something indescribable. Music isn\u2019t just notes on a page, but memories and feelings.

James was born in The Philippines, and grew up in a musical family: his mother is an elementary school choir teacher. So, James began with a curiosity towards music, which later turned into passion. At 15 years old, James saw ",Object(i.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"The Pianist"),", a film about a pianist living in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II. It was a very moving experience for him, and took up the piano. But that wasn\u2019t James\u2019 only motivation. To some extent, he states, \u201cI was engineered to be a professional concert pianist- that was the end goal of all piano students in The Philippines.\u201d James admits that goal was \u201cna\xefve,\u201d but it motivated him to attend a conservatory in Manila for a few years."),Object(i.a)("p",null,"When James turned 19, he moved to the US to attend undergrad conservatory. While there, James admitted, \u201cI became disillusioned with my concert pianist dreams.\u201d Conservatory life is no walk in the park. James sees being a professional musician soloist performer as akin to a professional sport, something you must dedicate your time and life to. Plus, James identified that \u201cthe way you play is so physical- in that respect, music literally is close to a sport.\u201d\xa0 That high time commitment was compounded by James\u2019 performer\u2019s anxiety, and he began questioning his motives for pursuing music performance. \u201cWas this even my own motivation?\u201d he wondered."),Object(i.a)("p",null,"James also felt restricted in his style. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain kind of playing you need to win a competition,\u201d he says, that focuses on technical accuracy and adherence to the composer\u2019s intention. A judge in a competition expects the pianists (perhaps rightly, in some cases) to be more recreative than creative. Performers must primarily pass on the composer\u2019s vision to the audience rather than completely reinterpreting it themselves. James\u2019 musical style is more personal. \u201cWho are you offending?\u201d James told me. \u201dBeethoven? He\u2019s deep in the ground. Don\u2019t be too restricted by the intentions of the composer.\u201d"),Object(i.a)("p",null,"He took a break, and started branching out into other realms of music, especially ballet and music theater. He liked those settings a lot more than classical solo piano, since he had to learn new skills. \u201cAll of a sudden, I had to develop my sight-reading skills, which I\u2019d never used before!\u201d James mused. \u201cA pit orchestra has much less time to rehearse than a soloist.\u201d The group nature of the pit orchestra also helped James\u2019 performance anxiety. According to James, \u201cThose new experiences saved me from dropping out of music completely.\u201d"),Object(i.a)("p",null,"After undergrad, James completed a Master\u2019s Degree in musicology and piano at University of Wisconsin. He began to recover his lost curiosity for music, being a part of a piano trio and continuing to play in pit orchestras. In 2024, he was accepted to the PhD program at Brown, but not for music, but for history instead. By then, James says, he had a better relationship with music. Rather than playing to match some vague expectation of \u201cbeing a concert pianist,\u201d James now performs music to discover \u201chow my playing can be fun.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure whether to participate in the BUO concerto competition, for fear that his playing style wouldn\u2019t be accepted, but resolved to take a risk. According to him, \u201cI thought, \u2018This might be your last chance in a while to play before the people, really have fun with the piece- play crazy interpretive stuff, milk ",Object(i.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"rubatos"),".' I was playing for myself, not to impress anyone. Pleasure stems ",Object(i.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"from")," being able to play for the public. Even if I didn\u2019t win the concerto competition, I was already happy.\u201d That happiness shone through, leading to James performing with the BUO this upcoming concert. James\u2019 chosen piece for the BUO concert, Fr\xe9d\xe9ric Chopin\u2019s ",Object(i.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Andante Spianato et Grande Polonaise Brillante"),", is meaningful to him as well. On a personal note, the ",Object(i.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Andante Spianato")," is featured in the final scene of ",Object(i.a)("em",{parentName:"p"},"The Pianist"),". James has also played it before, so performing it now enables him to focus on fine-tuning and enjoying the experience, rather than grinding and learning a new piece. His appreciation shines through in this playing, as he balances precise rhythms with his own personal movements."),Object(i.a)("p",null,"James has resolved to pursue history as his long-term career. He doesn\u2019t regret that decision, nor does he want to remove music from his life. In his History studies, James specializes on the role of sound throughout history- at Dachau, in Warsaw, and in the homes of everyday citizens. \u201cDid people hear the radio differently in the past? Did they feel things differently? That\u2019s so interesting to me,\u201d James remarked. James also has a specific interest in reconstructing \u201cforgotten\u201d musical pieces composed in the concentration camps like Dachau and Buchenwald- merging history and music. Music performance may not be what James staked his life on. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t meaningful for him. As a musician in BUO, I can feel that passion when playing with James, and we hope you feel the same in our music."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0;var c=function(){return[]},m={}}}]);
