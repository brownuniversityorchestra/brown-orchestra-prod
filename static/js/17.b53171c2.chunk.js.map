As a freshman, I would walk onto the north side of campus to hear rhythmic arpeggios of a trumpet soaring into the night, as late as 3AM from what I remember. And I always knew who it was–`}</p>\n    <p>{`William MacDonald grew up in Leipzig, Germany. His mother worked as an administrator for an orchestra, while his father was a professional trumpet player and conductor. `}</p>\n    <p>{`He actually started with the cello, which he admits didn’t suit him. But he played it well enough to audition into a music-focused school from 6th to 12th grade in Dresden.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There, he made the switch to trumpet. And as much as his practicing and training there shaped his trumpet playing, William would argue for the reverse: playing the trumpet shaped him. One memory in particular captures this dynamic. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Once, my trumpet teacher told me: we need a sub, come and play. And at the last moment, at a dress rehearsal he would do this crazy crap: he would say, ‘Why don’t you play first?’ And I go like, ‘what? In front of all of the pros?’ But it was to train me, to throw myself into water and swim and realize, ‘okay, it’s doable.’” `}</p>\n    <p>{`William credits playing the trumpet to transforming his approach to the different challenges and projects in his life. Before the switch, William recounts that a few moves back-and-forth between the U.S. and Germany demotivated him from embracing his studies and his life in Germany as a whole. But the precision and persistence required to learn and play trumpet pushed him to overcome these struggles. And by the end of high school, he planned to continue this journey into a career as a professional trumpet player.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In light of that expectation, his decision to come to Brown starting Fall 2019 was a leap into the unknown. He had auditioned for some conservatories, but he realized that coming to Brown would leave more career and life paths open. The first two years, William tells me, featured moments of heavy doubt because he worried that his decision was in part, a turning away from music. Despite these doubts and the sprawling diversity of interests to explore at Brown, he insisted on keeping trumpet playing as a core part of his college experience.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is the point where I first crossed paths with Will: walking onto the north side of campus and hearing him practice late at night. Part of this drive comes from the deep pride William takes in making music. He tells me that he envisions his way of overcoming performance nerves as the construction of a wall. This mental wall shields him from the doubts and anxious thoughts that often creep into a performer’s mind. To build it, he gathers moments of pride during his practice—a beautiful sound, a perfectly executed phrase, clean articulation—and he stacks these memories together into his wall of confidence. He has been building this wall throughout his time at Brown, and the fact that he knows he has improved since freshman year brings him steady pride for performances. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I ask William what he thinks about during his practice. In particular, when he is playing the Arutiunian Trumpet Concerto: is he thinking about a scene? Maybe a particular mood? Even a story? `}</p>\n    <p>{`William shakes his head: “I never really believed in that stuff. I’d rather hear someone tell me to play softer or louder than tell me to imagine something. Just doesn’t work for me… I’m mostly just focused on staying relaxed, taking open breaths.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Playing orchestral music isn’t an uncontrolled imaginative art for Will. Instead, it’s an athletic activity, consisting of unrelenting focus and discipline. When it comes to musical interpretation, his method is to just listen to a lot of music—ranging from classical music to funk and hip hop—with an attention to style. With this accumulation of musical data, the interpretative choices become something that’s intuitive, maybe instinctive. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This approach of drive and pride is a common thread in Will’s life outside of music. For a few years, William was a member of the Brown Sailing Team, which he found enjoyable for its combination of intermittent yelling from the coaches and cheers with his teammates. And for the future, William is planning to be a surgeon. The precision, focus, and self-mastery required for the work reminds William of what he enjoys most about trumpet playing. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I can see the connection in his performances, too. His shoulders back, standing tall, William takes a deep, relaxed breath to begin the first fanfare of the Arutiunian. Though there’s plenty of showmanship in the piece, his focus is fixed on his bodily tension and precise execution of the music. His eyes gaze into the back of the hall, like an athlete staring at his target in the distance, unfazed by the sights and sounds of a crowd gathered around him. It is at this point I realize that when William plays the trumpet, athleticism and art are one and the same.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
