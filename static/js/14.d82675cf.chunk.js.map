I had arrived without a single clue of what to expect; after all, the two pieces played by the duo at the concerts, W. A. Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante in E-flat Major and Kenji Bunch’s very own Verso, did not include trumpets as part of their orchestrations. Despite this, I had heard small snippets of Verso as I made my way out of Alumnae Hall in prior rehearsals, and the parts I did hear were nothing short of beautiful, so I had looked forward to hearing more about Bunch and Winterstein’s musical inspirations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Unsurprisingly, the first question directed at Bunch was probably what was on a lot of our minds: “How did you come to write Verso?” Bunch discussed how he was approached by the director of a music festival in Corvallis, Oregon (coincidentally also the birthplace of Katherine Winterstein) to write a piece for their 10th anniversary. On one hand, he recalled how elated and honored he was when he heard the news, thinking, “I’m not dead yet! They remember I write music!” However, the delayed reaction of fear eventually caught up when he realized, “I actually have to write this.” At that moment, he had suddenly bore the responsibility of a significant aspect of the festival: how could he deliver the piece in such a way that was appropriate for the Oregonian audience while also writing something that made sense for himself musically? After much deliberation, he came upon a “neoclassical, fake-baroque” style that he was happy about: combining the vocabulary of the classical canon without being “beholden to traditions” to do “subversive things”, like including a harpsichord for its antique timbre simply felt right. These ideas had all blended together into a singular score, creating the composition Verso, named after its Latin origins suggesting the turn of a page.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Although our curiosities surrounding Verso were somewhat satisfied, Bunch’s thorough answer actually posed more questions regarding his upbringing and inspirations for his compositions. Bunch attributes much of his compositional ideas to his parents, who appreciated music of all kinds: classical, opera, swing-era jazz, Broadway, and everything in between. Though not musicians themselves, Bunch’s parents enabled him to grow up without realizing that there is a sort of hierarchy of aesthetics in the classical music community, separating the classical world from what might be considered “outside music.” Especially as a violist himself, Bunch eventually encountered a disconnect between what’s performed within the classical canon and the music that is experienced “for fun, as people in the world.” To reconcile the two worlds, Bunch has strived to incorporate any kinds of music he loves into the music he plays. He recounted how mesmerized his high-school self was watching the Kronos Quartet play a cover of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze.” That performance sparked a desire for the college-aged Bunch to play in a rock band on the electric violin, which didn’t last long; though it was fun, he ultimately felt like he was on a “fake electric guitar,” instead of a truly standalone instrument. Then on a trip in Kentucky, he encountered “contemporary chamber music” — the genre of Bluegrass. With everyone playing on a different instrument with a different part, each musician was tasked to listen and to respond to one another while simultaneously improvising new material on the spot. Just like a true musician would, Bunch took it all back to school in New York, put together an ensemble of musicians. He vividly recalled how tough it was to start; their first performances at bars on Monday nights were met with empty audiences and payments to end their sets early. Like any other success story, though, their hard work began to land them Wednesday and Friday night shows, and eventually performances at larger festivals, and the band had stuck together for 15 years!`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our natural response to all this was, “But how did you do that?” I mean, it must have taken hours and hours of dedicated practice, which is totally understandable. But even so, how did Bunch really get started with improvising melodies out of thin air, like a magician pulling out a rabbit out of a hat? He didn’t outright give us the answer to his secrets, but he gave us a three-part point of entry. First, anyone who can do it now was probably terrible at some point, so one should keep attempting it while being patient. Second, one should develop their ear. Transcribing famous solos is very helpful in getting one’s ear to recognize the pitches and transmit them into their fingers. This development will enable one to learn the vocabulary of a given style requiring improvisation; like a learner of a Scottish accent listening to hours and hours of the Scottish accent, a jazz musician may need to actively listen and transcribe jazz music. For the third part of his answer, Bunch pulled out his instrument and encouraged us to do the same for some improvisation exercises. Whoops, I definitely should have brought mine — thankfully, the brave souls pictured above were happy to participate! `}</p>\n    <p>{`Before we formed our cute BUO-Bunch-Winterstein mini-ensemble, Bunch reassured us that we are not “bad at improvising.” Every day, we share conversations with others unscripted. Even the most busy days with a packed schedule require last-minute adjustments. Despite these challenges, we make it through the days by making things up on the spot. Bunch noted that in that way, music is simply a metaphor for the spontaneity of life. Now came the musical exercises. The first of the exercises was something Bunch did with his kids every morning, which was to “have the instruments talk to each other when they first meet.” In a circle, we each introduced our instruments with our instruments! Playing what weren’t exactly discernable notes, we shared a funny musical conversation. The other exercise was a memory game; again in our musical circle, Bunch would start by playing one note, then the next person would play the note and another, then the next would play the two notes and another. This went on for however long we could hold on to keep building our melody. Turns out students at Brown really do have the brains, as we went on for almost 20 notes before we lost track of where we were! `}</p>\n    <p>{`Before this workshop, I was not sure how I could advance my interests in music forward, as I felt like my time spent practicing was not paying its dividends and lacked greater implications. Now, I was given a toolbox and the inspiration to start a Bluegrass band of my own. More seriously, however, I saw music for what it was, a source of entertainment for everyone around the world. Bunch lamented that “in the classical world, entertainment is a dirty, pandering word,” and that this perception is misguided because as musicians, we are a part of the service industry being asked to heal the masses (even Mozart spent most of his career eating at the servant’s table!). Winterstein agreed that music is simply empathy given a physical form, and the experience of sharing music communally is truly a healing experience for all. As I continue to put in the hours practicing etudes and concertos, I will not forget how the music I synthesize may be used to make my audience feel raw emotions. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Thank you to both Kenji Bunch and Katherine Winterstein for providing such a wonderful experience to learn more about approaching musicality, I truly had a “bunch” of fun. `}</p>\n    {\n      /*EndFragment*/\n    }\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
