Though well-known in the music scene in her short life, like many women composers, she was forgotten by society after her death.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Boulanger grew up in a musical family. Her mother, Raïssa Myshetskaya, was a singer; her father, Ernest Boulanger, was a teacher at the Paris Conservatory; her sister, Nadia, would become one of the foremost composers of the 20th century, teaching prominent figures such as Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, and Quincy Jones. Lili often followed her sister Nadia to her music theory lessons at the Paris Conservatory at a young age, and later on learned the piano, violin, cello, and harp. She had survived pneumonia at the age of two and suffered from its aftereffects, as well as Crohn’s disease, throughout her life, which limited her prospects of marriage. So, when her father passed away at age 16, her mother encouraged Lili to take up a career in music as a means of supporting herself. Lili committed herself to composition, following in her sister’s footsteps.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Over her ten years of composition, she would produce over 50 works. She also became the first woman to win the prestigious composition competition, the Prix de Rome. Many of her pieces touch on themes of grief and death. D’un matin du printemps (Of a Spring Morning), was one of the last pieces she was able to notate herself. In 1918, at the age of 24, she passed away. Perhaps as a consequence of her short life, or for other reasons such as the period in which she lived or her gender, her music (and that of her sister) is only now gaining popularity. We hope our performance of D’un matin du printemps was able to represent the beauty of her music!`}</p>\n    <p>{`Sources:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Davis, Lizzie. “Ever Heard the Music of Lili Boulanger, One of the 20th Century’s Most Exciting Composers?” Classic FM, 25 June 2021, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/lili-boulanger/\"\n      }}>{`https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/lili-boulanger/`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Lili Boulanger - Classical Music Composers.” Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, 16 Apr. 2015, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.pcmsconcerts.org/composer/lili-boulanger/\"\n      }}>{`https://www.pcmsconcerts.org/composer/lili-boulanger/`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Staub, Heidi. “The Lost Promise of Composer Lili Boulanger.” Seattle Symphony, 31 Jan. 2018, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.seattlesymphony.org/en/beyond-the-stage/lili-boulanger\"\n      }}>{`https://www.seattlesymphony.org/en/beyond-the-stage/lili-boulanger`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
