My older brother played violin through the Suzuki method, so when I came along I started as well. I was three, but it was the sort of thing that “older brother does, so you do it too.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: That’s cool! Since you started with the violin, when was it that you transitioned your main focus to conducting? `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: I had my first opportunity to dabble in conducting in junior high, but it was really in college `}{`[`}{`at Yale] that I began to study conducting seriously and it became a focus of my musical activities. I took a few courses, but also started up a few student groups as an undergraduate, and just got bitten by the “conducting bug”… you know?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: Is that where you studied with Lawrence Leighton Smith and Shinik Hahm?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: Yes.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: Would you say that they were your musical role models? Or is there anyone else that stands out to you as being pivotal in your journey to getting here today?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: Gosh. I mean, there’s plenty of people. It’s hard to distill to the top one or even top two, because you learn different things from different teachers. I’m grateful to Shinik Hahm for the fact that he gave me a ton of opportunities. I got to read some crazy hard scores `}{`[`}{`with the Yale Symphony Orchestra], including Strauss’s Till Eulenspiegel and Hindemith’s Symphonic Metamorphosis. As an undergrad, it was amazing to get to do that, so I’m very grateful for those sorts of chances and the faith that he put in me. I would also say that the four summers I spent at the Pierre Monteux School in Maine studying with Michael Jinbo were very formative in terms of developing an appreciation for not only the foundational aspects of conducting as a sort of gestural technique, but also thinking about a respectful and empathetic relationship with an ensemble. That’s the ethos that I try to carry through in my own work, like how I think it’s important for me to show up and be there when orchestra members are moving chairs to set up because I don’t think any one person should be above that.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: Wow, that’s really interesting and meaningful. Considering how moving chairs is a very administrative and not-musical process, it’s really cool to see how you view it.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: I mean, obviously it’d be great if there was somebody that did that for us, but both metaphorically as well as in a concrete sense, we’re all kind of moving the chairs together. `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: Going back to musical influences, is there anyone that really influenced you and made you look at music in a different way?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: There are many people that I look up to in our field as role models for how music can be a vehicle for meaningful, engaged citizenship. Gabriela Lena Frank’s talk `}{`[`}{`via a Zoom session with BUO in February 2022] about the work that she does was very inspiring. John Luther Adams, whom I got to work with a few years ago, sees music and environmentalism as connected, in that what you do as an artist is not just confined to the world of art, but can also have meaningful impacts in the wider world. That’s something that I’ve tried to think about as a guiding principle.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: That’s really intriguing to hear about, and thanks for sharing! On a lighter note, what would you say your favorite musical experience has been at The Chelsea Symphony?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: We did a performance of John Luther Adams’s Become Ocean on Earth Day at the American Museum of Natural History—in the Hall of Ocean Life, underneath the giant whale suspended from the ceiling. We had a panel with John Luther Adams and one of the scientists from the Museum of Natural History who spoke about ecological concerns and the science of the ocean. That was a very cool and very singular experience. An ongoing project we have been doing, in partnership with the New York City Department of Correction, has been to take chamber groups (and once, a full orchestra) into their facilities, including Rikers Island. We had to pivot to digital programming when the pandemic hit, and haven’t yet been able to get back to do any in-person visits, but that’s work which has been very meaningful to me.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: What about at Brown?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: It’s hard to single out one experience because there have been so many different projects with amazing collaborators. But if I had to pick, probably our residency with Jennifer Koh and Vijay Iyer `}{`[`}{`in February/March 2020].`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: You might have already answered this in the previous question, but what’s an experience you’ve had that was really unexpected? Something that if you had heard of it ten years ago you wouldn’t have been able to believe.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: I wouldn’t have ever thought that I would share a screen with Gael García Bernal `}{`[`}{`on the Amazon show Mozart in the Jungle], but that happened. It wasn’t actually a real performance, but I’d say probably that. `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: That’s awesome. Apart from being a conductor, you’re also very much a musicologist, and you’ve done research exploring issues of influence and cultural identity in Paris. If it has, how would you say that has translated into the repertoire that you select for orchestras for performance?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: In a narrow sense, there are a couple works that I’ve been able to program because of that research interest. `}{`[`}{`Augusta] Holmès’s La Nuit et l’Amour, which BUO did in November 2021, was a direct result of having spent time in the archives in Paris, and I thought, “Oh, here’s this piece, and I’m going to transcribe it for performance.” More broadly, the questions that I explore as a musicologist—how people express or connect to cultural identity through music—are also questions that inform my thinking about programming at large. For instance, I find Gabriela Lena Frank’s music very interesting: she’s very thoughtful about reflecting on her multicultural heritage, what it means to create music that is a piece of her, and that draws on all these various influences that are inextricably interwoven with her biography. Even though that’s not strictly speaking in the same cultural wheelhouse as my research, it’s still informed by the same sorts of questions that I find really interesting.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: Do you think you’re going to make a return to Paris to go see the archives soon?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: I hope so. For better or worse, one thing that’s good for research these days is that more and more things are digitized so you know, I’ll take an excuse or reason to go back there. The last time I was in Paris was in 2015, so that was a while ago!`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ry`}</strong>{`: We’ve seen you perform as a conductor many times. Will we ever see you perform as a violinist showing off some Suzuki method?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: Um, I wouldn’t count on it. `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Annie`}</strong>{`: Hypothetically, if you had to spend your career as an instrumentalist in any genre, what instrument would you play, and what genre would you play in? `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: Well, the way that The Chelsea Symphony works is that we have a rotational model, so when I’m not conducting I actually play violin in the orchestra. But as to Annie’s question, I think there’s an opportunity now to think about string instruments in a more expansive kind of way, so if I were a violinist I wouldn’t just want to be a classical violinist in an orchestra. I would want to try to think about what that could entail in terms of maybe playing cross-genre music or in cross-disciplinary types of collaborations.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Annie`}</strong>{`: It’s a famous fact amongst the orchestra that you have insane perfect pitch. How did you first realize you had this skill?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: So, this sounds crazy but it’s absolutely true. It was my freshman year in high school, and there was a week or so when I just had an A ringing in my head. And then, after that, I had pitch memory. So, for the record, it is not the same thing as neurological absolute pitch, it’s more like highly developed pitch memory.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Annie`}</strong>{`: What’s your bubble tea order?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: You’re actually the second person to ask me this in the span of two weeks! Green milk tea, 30% sugar. As for ice level, that depends on the time of the year.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Annie`}</strong>{`: What do you like to do in your spare time?`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mark`}</strong>{`: Well, something that I took up last year was vegetable gardening. In the midst of the pandemic, it was both restorative and quite literally fruitful. It’s amazing to be able to grow something from seed and then be able to cultivate it into actual food.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`\\\\    `}</p>\n    <p>{`Read more on Mark’s music career `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.markseto.com/about\"\n      }}>{`here`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
