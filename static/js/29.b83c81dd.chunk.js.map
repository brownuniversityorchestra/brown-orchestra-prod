For many in the audience, this will be their first time hearing the piece. In my sit-down interview with Robert ahead of his performance, he thinks back to when he first heard the concerto years ago in a public concert given by a special pianist: his brother.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Raised in Los Angeles, Robert was surrounded by music from an early age. His mother studied classical music, and he began taking piano lessons at the age of four. When Robert was ten, his then thirteen-year-old brother won a local competition to perform the Grieg concerto with an orchestra. Listening to this performance was a moving experience for Robert and sparked both a lasting appreciation for Grieg’s work and a deeper commitment to studying music. He learned the first movement in high school while participating in competitions himself. While his brother would go on to pursue music professionally, Robert never seriously considered a career as a pianist; for him, music provided an oasis from other responsibilities.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As he navigated his teenage years, Robert found himself drawn to another focus: chess. The strategic depth and intricate patterns of the game fascinated him, offering not just an escape but also a competitive thrill. He spent weekends at a local chess club, eventually earning the prestigious title of International Master. Chess shared common ground with music; both pursuits involve meticulous attention to detail coupled with an intuitive sense of the bigger picture. But while chess is by nature competitive, Robert found music to be an intimate pursuit which allowed him to express himself authentically. “Even though a game of chess can last hours, the outcome can be determined by a single mistake early on,” he explains. “Music is more artistic,” he adds, “Music is something for the soul.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`The music department at Brown was a significant draw for Robert. During a visit, he received an impromptu tour of the music facilities from Drew Moser, the Communications and Outreach Coordinator for Brown’s Orwig Music Library. Moser’s willingness to share insights gave Robert a sense of belonging even before officially arriving as a student. Once at Brown, he began studying piano under Assistant Professor of Music Saleem Ashkar, whose intelligence and artistic vision captivated him. Professor Ashkar taught Robert a powerful lesson: the more you understand a passage, the easier it becomes to play. Instead of practicing a section a hundred times in hopes of improvement, Robert learned to focus on the details, often finding that one or two thoughtful playthroughs is enough. Professor Ashkar’s clear interpretational vision of how each passage should sound influenced the sense of intention with which Robert learns and prepares his music. Academically, Robert is studying mathematics and computer science and plans to pursue graduate research in math. “There’s a purity in math that I find beautiful,” he says. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A Minor is a multifaceted work that Robert describes as a “synergy of two elements.” It combines the classical form one expects from a concerto with the vibrant influence of Norwegian folk music. Beginning with its iconic opening piano phrase, the first movement centers around two themes and follows a strict sonata form. The second movement features a delicately gorgeous piano line that emerges after an orchestral introduction, evoking the image of “a bird singing.” The third movement, a lively Norwegian dance, showcases Grieg’s ability to infuse national identity into formal structures. Robert explains, “It really sounds composite,” reflecting how the piece embodies both tradition and innovation.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Robert’s own interpretation is influenced by his favorite recordings, especially those by Dinu Lipatti and Martha Argerich. He classifies pianists into two types: those who follow the music and those who impose their will upon it. Lipatti, he believes, exemplifies the former, allowing the music to guide him. Argerich, on the other hand, takes the piece on a “roller-coaster ride” with her fast-paced approach, showcasing the charm and excitement that can be drawn from the work. As Robert prepares for his performance, he looks forward to the climax in the first movement–the cadenza. This moment is not only a tour de force of technical virtuosity but also represents a transformation within the piece. “It pushes the idea of a cadenza to its absolute limit, both in length and substance,” he explains. The original theme, now in octaves, serves as a powerful culmination of the movement.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite its popularity, the Grieg concerto often faces criticism for being too theatrical or musically “unserious.” Robert disagrees, saying, “Grieg was very meticulous about how he wrote the piece. It sounds fresh.” However, he acknowledges the importance of avoiding a performance that feels overly virtuosic or rehearsed, wary of the “danger of sounding too perfunctory.” He notes that maintaining excitement throughout the piece is a balance that requires sensitivity: “You always have to have all these ideas in your head and adjust even within a performance.” Robert hopes that the audience experiences the Grieg concerto in a way that resonates with them, just as he did years ago while listening to his brother.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While pursuing an academic career in mathematics and working towards becoming a chess Grandmaster, Robert is confident music will continue to be a core part of his life. “I never did it for anything external anyways,” he confesses, “Music was always something I did for myself.”`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
