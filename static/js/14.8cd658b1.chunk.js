I mean, there\u2019s plenty of people. It\u2019s hard to distill to the top one or even top two, because you learn different things from different teachers. I\u2019m grateful to Shinik Hahm for the fact that he gave me a ton of opportunities. I got to read some crazy hard scores ","[","with the Yale Symphony Orchestra], including Strauss\u2019s Till Eulenspiegel and Hindemith\u2019s Symphonic Metamorphosis. As an undergrad, it was amazing to get to do that, so I\u2019m very grateful for those sorts of chances and the faith that he put in me. I would also say that the four summers I spent at the Pierre Monteux School in Maine studying with Michael Jinbo were very formative in terms of developing an appreciation for not only the foundational aspects of conducting as a sort of gestural technique, but also thinking about a respectful and empathetic relationship with an ensemble. That\u2019s the ethos that I try to carry through in my own work, like how I think it\u2019s important for me to show up and be there when orchestra members are moving chairs to set up because I don\u2019t think any one person should be above that."),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ry"),": Wow, that\u2019s really interesting and meaningful.

Gabriela Lena Frank\u2019s talk ","[","via a Zoom session with BUO in February 2022] about the work that she does was very inspiring. John Luther Adams, whom I got to work with a few years ago, sees music and environmentalism as connected, in that what you do as an artist is not just confined to the world of art, but can also have meaningful impacts in the wider world. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve tried to think about as a guiding principle."),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ry"),": That\u2019s really intriguing to hear about, and thanks for sharing! On a lighter note, what would you say your favorite musical experience has been at The Chelsea Symphony?"),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Mark"),": We did a performance of John Luther Adams\u2019s Become Ocean on Earth Day at the American Museum of Natural History\u2014in the Hall of Ocean Life, underneath the giant whale suspended from the ceiling. We had a panel with John Luther Adams and one of the scientists from the Museum of Natural History who spoke about ecological concerns and the science of the ocean. That was a very cool and very singular experience. An ongoing project we have been doing, in partnership with the New York City Department of Correction, has been to take chamber groups (and once, a full orchestra) into their facilities, including Rikers Island. We had to pivot to digital programming when the pandemic hit, and haven\u2019t yet been able to get back to do any in-person visits, but that\u2019s work which has been very meaningful to me."),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ry"),": What about at Brown?"),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Mark"),": It\u2019s hard to single out one experience because there have been so many different projects with amazing collaborators.

Apart from being a conductor, you\u2019re also very much a musicologist, and you\u2019ve done research exploring issues of influence and cultural identity in Paris.

","[","Augusta] Holm\xe8s\u2019s La Nuit et l\u2019Amour, which BUO did in November 2021, was a direct result of having spent time in the archives in Paris, and I thought, \u201cOh, here\u2019s this piece, and I\u2019m going to transcribe it for performance.\u201d More broadly, the questions that I explore as a musicologist\u2014how people express or connect to cultural identity through music\u2014are also questions that inform my thinking about programming at large. For instance, I find Gabriela Lena Frank\u2019s music very interesting: she\u2019s very thoughtful about reflecting on her multicultural heritage, what it means to create music that is a piece of her, and that draws on all these various influences that are inextricably interwoven with her biography. Even though that\u2019s not strictly speaking in the same cultural wheelhouse as my research, it\u2019s still informed by the same sorts of questions that I find really interesting."),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ry"),": Do you think you\u2019re going to make a return to Paris to go see the archives soon?"),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Mark"),": I hope so. For better or worse, one thing that\u2019s good for research these days is that more and more things are digitized so you know, I\u2019ll take an excuse or reason to go back there.

"),Object(o.a)("p",null,Object(o.a)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Mark"),": Well, the way that The Chelsea Symphony works is that we have a rotational model, so when I\u2019m not conducting I actually play violin in the orchestra. But as to Annie\u2019s question, I think there\u2019s an opportunity now to think about string instruments in a more expansive kind of way, so if I were a violinist I wouldn\u2019t just want to be a classical violinist in an orchestra.

It was my freshman year in high school, and there was a week or so when I just had an A ringing in my head. And then, after that, I had pitch memory.
