The cloaked, mysterious being who emerges slowly makes his way to the keyboard of the century-old organ. And as he begins to play, the hall fills with the music of an iconic Brown tradition, the Halloween midnight organ concert.`}</p>\n    <p>{`University organist Mark Steinbach is a well-known and treasured member of Brown’s music faculty with an impressive resume beyond the cherished midnight organ concerts. He’s performed and taught all over the world, from Xi’an to Dresden, recorded countless pieces, and dedicated himself to historical (and contemporary) organ performance as well as historical musicology. One of Professor Steinbach’s most recent projects has been performing with the Brown University Orchestra Samuel Barber’s Toccata Festiva and Ottorino Respighi’s Vetrate di Chiesa (Church Windows). After he led us on a tour through the 1903 organ in Sayles Hall, we sat down with Professor Steinbach to talk about the organ, history, and music.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`How would you describe the Sayles Hall organ?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“According to Encyclopedia Brunonia, by 1900 the students were going to the administration and saying ‘We need a pipe organ.’ And so by 1902, president Faunce wrote that ‘a pipe organ in Sayles hall is our biggest small need.’`}</p>\n    <p>{`… “The sound of 19th century French organs is very different from German organs. The French will say ‘you cannot play French music on a German instrument, it’s impossible!’ and the Germans will say ‘the French can’t play Bach!’ Then you go to Italy and they say ‘the Germans know nothing about Italian music, neither do the French!’ What do you think an American organ `}{`[like the Sayles organ]`}{` is like? It’s a mongrel! Some stops sound English, another reed is French; it’s typical American organ design to have amalgamations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`… “The similarity between piano and organ ends at the keyboard. The pipe organ is a wind instrument, and the piano is a percussion instrument. You articulate each voice differently on the organ, and you have so many different choices of colors from the stops. And then of course the building is the resonator chamber, like the body of a violin—Sayles hall itself is an instrument.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`What is it that you love about the organ?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“I think that one of the most exciting things is that I get to go to old places and play old instruments or new instruments—the old ones tell you something about the time period in which they were built. If you play this `}{`[Sayles Hall]`}{` instrument to an expert they’d say ‘sounds like turn of the century Americana.’ Which Sayles looks like too! You have elements of romanesque architecture, late 19th century dark wood, Victorian windows and drapes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`… “If you just studied the organs in these different countries, you’d learn world history. In Switzerland when Calvinism spread, they destroyed organs; they literally hacked them up. They believed the organs were papist idolatry and they went back to a literal reading of some scriptures that say you should only praise God by singing psalms and spiritual songs, but no instruments. The extremists also destroyed stained glass windows—that was idolatry, statuaries had to go too—so if you ever go to Switzerland, notice the walls are frequently white; you don’t see the beautiful frescoes that would have been there years before, and the organs tend to be new. But in the Netherlands, which was also under the influence of the Calvinists, they saved the instruments, but the way they got around that was they said ‘ok the organ is going to belong to the city and we won’t use it for church services, but we will use it for organ recitals every Sunday afternoon, and they’ll be played by the municipal organist.’ So fortunately, the Netherlands has incredible old organs.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Thoughts on performing with BUO this past semester?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“There’s very little repertoire for organ and orchestra. That’s what makes `}{`[playing with the orchestra]`}{` so special. Not all halls have an organ in them. That determines a lot. New York doesn’t have an organ in its hall, which is a moral outrage… It’s an absolute thrill to be able to `}{`[play an organ-orchestra piece]`}{` because it’s a rarity, because there’s just not that much literature and we just don’t get to do it that often.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“But one of the things I love about hearing the orchestra in `}{`[Sayles]`}{` is that the sound is so immediate. Yes, there are problems with having no stage, you can’t see the performers so well—it’s a big orchestra—but it’s almost like listening to chamber music. You’re right there, you’re so close to the musicians, the sound is big and immediate. It’s very exciting! I had friends who came from New York, and one of them was on the board of the NY philharmonic, and they were not expecting it I think, but they said it was so great! You guys are completely dedicated, giving 100%.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Respighi was an Italian composer writing in the early 1900’s, and Barber came along decades later in the US. How do you adapt your playing for these two pieces, each with their own histories and styles?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“Adapting… it’s like cooking. So you’re making a French recipe but you’re in Pawtucket, RI. What do we have available in our cabinet or the market? I don’t have Tarragon, but I have a spice that’s kind of close to that. Oops, we don’t have lamb, but we have a vegetarian soy lamb. So you make all these adaptations, and because the organ played a more minor role `}{`[in the Respighi]`}{`, I don’t think it was so difficult to adapt to this organ, plus the piece was written around the time this `}{`[Sayles]`}{` organ was built, so it was easy to adapt. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Barber’s piece is like a catalog of 20th-century compositional techniques. Look at the beginning: all those scales—Phrygian scale, then Lydian scale. Mixolydian. He’s going through the modes! And then of course the pedal solo `}{`[cadenza]`}{` is really difficult. When I posted on social media that I was doing this piece, some organ friends said: “be careful of that page turn part. I practiced that part a million times and never got it right.” Thanks for letting me know! But that run where you go from the bottom to the top—it’s just an octatonic scale, but alternating feet ascending. And then Barber did crazy things like play 3 notes with one foot, play double stops with your foot—he was also trying to show off how he could write a challenging piece for the organ.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Barber’s sort of a romantic, and you can’t just say he’s a modernist. Think about Adagio for Strings, I mean that piece is completely romantic. He’s a romantic living in the 1960’s. What’s a guy to do? He wasn’t afraid to write in a post-romantic style that incorporated new ideas, new rhythms, but I think if you played the more rhythmic passages too freely you’d lose the dialogue. A lot of it was perpetual motion. The way the rhythm was notated could dictate how you play it.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Anything you’re excited about for organ and music at Brown?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“The organ’s currently being renovated, and I’m excited to get it up and playing again when it’s finished. There’s no reason this organ can’t be playing for another 200 years, so we’re conserving it for the future. I also think we have to do an organ-orchestra piece every 4 years, so that each class can have an important educational opportunity playing with organ. I feel I owe it to the composition department and the students because they have this great opportunity here to learn how to compose for this strange instrument which is usually in some far-off balcony.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Do you have any advice for young composers/musicians?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“Take as many different music courses at Brown as you possibly can. This is your chance to get outside input on your music. When you leave Brown you can always write music and listen to lots of music, but to actually get feedback—I hear from my students, I think of my graduate school—I learned as much from my peers as from my teachers. The connections you make, going into each others’ practice rooms, playing your pieces for each other… I know at Brown that’s what the composers do here through the Fermata `}{`[music composition]`}{` student-run group. So it’s not always about getting professors’ input, it’s also just about getting your peers’, and those connections you make you’ll keep for the rest of your life.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“You’ll certainly keep those connections through orchestra, I mean the community you guys have built is incredible, and I know through the years, just performing together creates these tight bonds. I think it also helps that you share your lives, a lot of you know each other—there’s nothing like making music together in college I think, unless you start your own small ensemble. I think playing in a professional orchestra is so different because you check in, now it’s 9:30 we check out no matter where we’re at in the music-making… but you’re not necessarily hanging out with the people during the week.”`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Do you think the organ has a big role on campus?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`“The organ seems to be very popular at Brown, and I think part of that is the centrality of the location, also that Sayles isn’t in a churchly chapel, where there are these hard uncomfortable seats with pews where you all sit and face straight ahead. I just feel like it’s so Brown, and I just love it. When I came to Brown I heard ‘yeah they used to have these midnight organ recitals where students would come sit on the floor,’ and I was like ‘oh wow!” and now I’ve created this monster; it’s become very popular! It’s so much fun, because it’s a great way to hear the organ! I love the informality of it, I love sharing this instrument and the repertoire in an informal way, and the students are so respectful of it… You know, I’ve been playing the organ here for over 250 years! My spirit is raised every year to play the midnight organ recital for Halloween.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“But I’m just thrilled the organ is popular at Brown. I think the students love it, because they feel like it’s theirs, which makes me really happy, because it should be played and enjoyed. I was there your second day at Brown `}{`[Orientation]`}{` and I’ll be there when you graduate. I like that. It’s a ritual—it’s a ritualistic instrument.”`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
