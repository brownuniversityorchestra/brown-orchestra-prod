Since her entrance to the music world 12 years ago, she has become an accomplished musician, versed in a multitude of instruments such as the piano, clarinet, violin, drums, and guitar. Her outstanding history includes events such as performing in other countries such as China, Hong Kong, and London, winning a nationwide concerto competition, and performing a concerto with one of Korea’s most prestigious orchestras, City Philharmonic in Korea.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Her previous knowledge of the piece inspired her to revisit her concerto, Fantaisie Brillante on Themes from Bizet’s Carmen by François Borne, with the BUO. She expressed how it was “an honor to perform as a soloist” and enjoyed rehearsing with Conductor Mark Seto and the orchestra, especially appreciating his attention to detail and constant communication.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was truly the orchestra’s joy to be able to accompany Judy Lee this past March cycle, and while she is not sure of any concerto performances in the near future, she hopes to continue as a flutist for the orchestra while navigating her upcoming upperclassman years. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I﻿nterview by Haley Seo and Brian Lee`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\nexport const tableOfContents = (components={}) => [\n  \n]\n\nexport const frontMatter = {}\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
