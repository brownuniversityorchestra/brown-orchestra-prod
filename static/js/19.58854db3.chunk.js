I\u2019m Sabrina Chiang, the 2022\u20132023 BUO President! While I really cherished my time as Vice President last year with Haley Seo \u201823 as President, I had many worries coming in this year as I had big shoes to fill not only from Haley but also from previous BUO leadership. But after reviewing our feedback form at the end of the year and seeing that the orchestra placed a major emphasis on social events, I felt confident about where I wanted to devote myself this year."),Object(n.a)("p",null,"During my years serving on the Junior and Senior Class Coordinating Boards, I witnessed the critical role of social events in building a vibrant community. And what more dynamic community is there than the orchestra? Yet, I also learned that social events can achieve the goal of building community only if safety, well-being, and accountability are addressed and ensured. So, over this past summer, Chris Shin, 2022\u20132023 Vice President, and I drafted a BUO Board Constitution outlining these values, which will be ready for ratification next semester. "),Object(n.a)("p",null,"Meanwhile, during the semester, we created a new team on the board titled \u201cSocial Team\u201d as a new entry-level position in addition to the classic \u201cLibrarian\u201d role. The board also continued our traditional \u201cOrchestra Families,\u201d in which \u201cParents\u201d are randomly grouped with \u201cChildren\u201d to form the titular Orchestra Family. The goal is to facilitate orchestra members to meet other members they potentially wouldn\u2019t have otherwise gotten to know. And learning from last year, this year we especially encouraged \u201cCo-Parenting\u201d so the responsibility doesn\u2019t all lie on one person, and we introduced the concept of \u201cTwins,\u201d so newcomers don\u2019t feel intimidated joining a family on their own. "),Object(n.a)("p",null,"In addition to Orchestra Families, the board also hosted a \u201cFriendsgiving Dinner\u201d for those who were still on campus close to Thanksgiving, and a \u201cKahoot & Cupcake Night.\u201d Our \u201cKahoot & Cupcake Night\u201d featured trivia-style questions about BUO and our conductor, Mark Seto, such as \u201cWhat is Mark\u2019s boba order?\u201d (hint: the answer is in our previous newsletter!); and sweet treats baked by our lovely Orchestra Families! Through these events, I realized that even the makeup of the orchestra lends itself to the importance of community: the orchestra is composed of the music and the people\u2014and without either one, the orchestra simply would not exist.

Without their work, this newsletter would not have been possible. I also want to thank the rest of the board for everyone\u2019s dedication to the board and the orchestra.
